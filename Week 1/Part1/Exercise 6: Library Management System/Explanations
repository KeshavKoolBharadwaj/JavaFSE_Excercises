Q1) Explain linear search and binary search algorithms
      Linear Search:
      o	Linear search is the simplest search algorithm.
      o	It checks each element in the list until the target element is found or the list ends.
      o	Time Complexity: 𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of elements in the list.
      
      Binary Search:
      o	Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list.
      o	It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, 
        it searches the left half, otherwise, it searches the right half.
      o	Time Complexity: 𝑂(log𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of elements in the list.
      o	Requirement: The list must be sorted
